# Industry Centralization
For this project, I chose to examine additional variables that could be considered to be affect consumer welfare by examining forces at play in the distribution of power in markets. Given the opaque nature of financial data, it is difficult for the average person to gain a larger understanding of capital and market power by different sectors and industries. I worked on combining many sources of data to map revenue, market cap, CEO compensation, number of employees, employee compensation to individual sectors and industries and plan to continuously release this data as publicly as possible

##CEO Pay Ratio
Finally, I scraped and cleaned up CEO compensation, employee compensation, number of employees, and revenue share/market cap to examine sector and industry wide standards in "CEO pay ratio" - the ratio that of how much more a CEO makes than his employees.
