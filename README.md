# Industry Centralization
For this project, I chose to examine additional variables that could be considered to be affect consumer welfare by examining forces at play in the distribution of power in markets. Given the opaque nature of financial data, it is difficult for the average person to gain a larger understanding of capital and market power by different sectors and industries.
